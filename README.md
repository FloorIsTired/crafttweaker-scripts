# Homestead Server - Custom CraftTweaker Scripts

## 👋 Welcome to the Homestead Server!

This repository contains the custom CraftTweaker scripts that help make our "Homestead" Minecraft server unique! These scripts modify and enhance gameplay, ensuring a balanced, fun, and custom experience for all our players.

[CraftTweaker](https://docs.blamejared.com/) is a Minecraft mod that allows us to customize the game by changing recipes, removing items, adding new functionalities, and tweaking how different mods interact. Think of these scripts as the "house rules" and special customizations for our server's version of modded Minecraft.

## 🏡 Our Homestead Server Details

These scripts are specifically for:

- **Server Name:** Homestead MC
- **Minecraft Version:** Fabric 1.20.1
- **Primary Modpack:** [Homestead](https://modrinth.com/modpack/homestead)
- **Server Focus:** A community Homestead based survival server with a create focus!

## 💾 Installation

**Players generally do not need to install these scripts manually!** These scripts run on the server-side. When you connect to our Homestead server with the correct modpack/mod list, these changes will automatically apply to your game experience while you are on the server.
**If you want to install them for singleplayer use anyway the instructions are similar**, just find your modded minecraft instance's scripts folder.

**For A Server:**

1.  The scripts (`.zs` files) in this repository should be placed in the `scripts` folder located in the server's main directory (the same level as the `mods` and `config` folders).
2.  Tweak the scripts as you would like and save your changes.
3.  The server will load these scripts on startup or a `/reload`.

## 🔗 Compatibility

These scripts are designed to work with:

- **Minecraft Version:** Fabric 1.20.1
- **Our Server's Modpack:** [Homestead](https://modrinth.com/modpack/homestead)
